User stories for war:<br />
1. As a user, I want to be able to be able to see html representations of cards because text based games are boring.<br />
2. As a user, I want to be able to reset the game with a button so that I don't have to reload the page.<br />
3. As a user, I want to be able to hear sounds whenever something happens (shuffling a deck, dealing cards) because sounds will make the game more immersive.<br />
4. As a user, I want to be able to mute the sounds because sometimes I'd rather listen to music while playing war.<br />
5. As a user, I want to be able to play against the computer because my friends won't always want to play war.<br />
